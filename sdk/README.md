# JUJUCOIN ICO

This is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) DApp. It is my official submission for the BHCA-BUNZZ Hackathon.

This is my first time creating one and was made possible using the following:

>1. [Bunzz](https://app.bunzz.dev/)
>
>2. Bunzz-SDK
>
>3. Next.js

Bunzz provides me with a platform to deploy contracts without actually writing any code.

For this project, I deployed the ICO Template which consists of the ERC20 Token Module and the ICO DApp module.

On the backend dashboard of my Bunzz, I could see all the functions of the deployed contracts.

For example, I was able to mint and set the price for JujuCoin all from the DApp dashboard.

This current version is a basic version. There is only one function called at the frontend which is the **BUY** function.

At the frontend, click on **Join Us** to buy JujuCoin.

The least you can buy is 1 JujuCoin and it will cost you 0.001 ETH (Goerli Testnet).

As always, I welcome suggestions and critics. Thank you.
